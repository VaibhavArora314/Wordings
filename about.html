        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Birth of The Wordings</h3>
        <p>
          The founder of 'The Wordings' started his writing journey 3 years ago.
          In June 2021, he joined Instagram to start his writing page to spill
          the thoughts that made him a writer. After a few days, he got an
          anthology offer for co-authoring in a reputed publication, luckily, he
          submitted 3 entries in 3 different books and got a selection in all 3.
          A few days passed by, he got a compiler offer from another reputed
          publication. As this was his first opportunity, when he was about to
          start a different life from scratch, so he grabbed it and compiled his
          first project. This was his entry into the publication Industry.
        </p>
        <h3>Compilation Experience</h3>
        <p>
          The compilation is not an easy task. Every compiler grinds day and
          night to find some deserving and limited writers for their anthology,
          suffers mentally when they don't get a single response or writers for
          their anthology. After suffering from all these, they were not getting
          the respect and appreciation that they deserve. They were getting
          ill-treated by their Project Heads and Publication Houses. Even after
          sacrificing important events and sleep a compiler works very hard to
          complete a project on time. He faced the same experience, Publication
          house was burdening every task on him and blaming him for their own
          mistakes.
        </p>
        <h3>Co-author Experience</h3>
        <p>
          As a co-author of those 3 anthologies, he was waiting for his books to
          be in his hand for the past 5 months but it was not delivered and
          there was no response from the publication house. When he tried to
          contact them on their official numbers there was no response or any
          update for the same.<br /><br />
          A writer is a person who is the most important part of any book, who
          creates content for a book, who creates a writeup possible that can be
          published in a book. As a co-author in anthologies no co-author was
          getting the admiration that they deserve for their content nor they
          were getting any royalty on sales of books.
        </p>
        <h3>Dreamt to be the Change</h3>
        <p>
          After connecting with many writers, co-authors, and compilers of many
          anthologies of various publications and knowing their experiences, how
          publication houses are piling every burden on compilers and their
          Interns. How co-authors were not getting any appreciation for their
          content nor they were any customer support. A believer in “Be The
          Change What you want to see.” He decided to start a publication house
          that is writer-friendly with 4 pillars namely authenticity,
          admiration, 24*7 author support, and author satisfaction as their
          priority. Along with that, he decided to provide royalty on sales to
          each co-author for their book.
